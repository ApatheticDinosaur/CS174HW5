Using beautifulsoup4, I scraped the website and took a look at its html tree.
I figured out where the needed content was, in this case in the courses_adblock_start tags.
I scraped the course title from the course title child, the image source from the image tag's
attributes, and the link from the parent tag. These were stored locally during python execution
I then made a template for the website that you are currently looking at right now and
created a new course (row) for each course. I did this by creating a template for each row, formated
them, and concatinated them to the starting template. I then added the ending ones and called the
web browser.
